## Synopsis
Wedding Planner is a web app that allows registered users to plan a wedding. Visitors can RSVP to weddings and view attendee lists! I built this project using C# and ASP.NET Core framework.

## Direct Goals
1. Build a web app functioning as an event calendar for wedding dates & RSVPs.
2. Create a useful general template that can be repurposed for other events services.
3. Practicing object relational mapping with Entity.
4. Implement search function for displaying specified results on pages.
5. Developing my skills in C# and ASP.NET Core.

## Features
- Uses Google Maps API to display wedding addresses.
- Combines multiple models together with many-to-many relationships.
- Form validations screen incoming data prior to entering database.
- Secures sensitive user information using hashing.
- Connects to MySQL database via Entity ORM.
- Used Twitter Bootstrap for basic styling.
- Secure connection strings using dependency injection.
